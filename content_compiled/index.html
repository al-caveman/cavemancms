<h2 id="1"><a class="hindex" href="#1">1.</a> consciousness, freewill, AI</h2>

<h3 id="1.1"><a class="hindex" href="#1.1">1.1.</a> my thoughts on consciousness</h3>

<p>I look at consciousness as the thing that gives us a <em>point of view</em>, or
<em>point of experience</em>, which is more fundamental than feeling pain or joy.
We may call it the feeling of feeling at all, including the simple feeling
of observing things.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this further: if we imagine a robot with sensors, we can
programme it to read sensory data, process it, and react according to the
processed data in a seemingly sophisticated way that resembles the
behaviour of what we call an <em>animal</em>, or a form of <em>life</em>.</p>

<p>However, the question would remain:  does the robot really have its sensory
input connected to a point of experience?  Or is it simply a <em>blind</em>
action-reaction machine similar to the domino effect (but more complex)?
Why would the increased complexity suddenly grant the robot <em>point of
experience</em>?  I call an action-reaction <em>blind</em> if I want to claim that it
is not attached to any point of view/experience/feeling.</p>

<p>Based on the fundamental particles in the standard physics model, I cannot
find any way that complexity could suddenly give rise to the feeling of
feeling, or the feeling of having inputs attached to a point of view.  I
can only find a collection of particles that explain the <em>blind</em>
action-reaction.</p>

<p>Since it seems that we cannot explain the existence of the point of
experience from the standard physics model, I'm lead to the following
hypothesis:</p>

<ul>
<li> If the <em>point of experience</em> is not explainable by the existing particles
  in the standard physics model, then we have to introduce a new
  fundamental particle.  Let's call this new fundamental particle <span class="ignored">$x$</span>.</li>
<li> <span class="ignored">$x$</span> might be randomly roaming in space, in an attempt to find a
  complex-enough action-reaction machine, that is likely <em>blind</em>, in order
  to <em>attach</em> to it.</li>
<li> Once <span class="ignored">$x$</span> attaches to an action-reaction machine, it ends up connecting
  machine's <em>blind</em> input to <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s input.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this view, the reason we (e.g. humans) have a point of experience (or
feel of feeling, at all), is because each of us is an <span class="ignored">$x$</span> that is attached
to a complex enough action-reaction machine that is our physical/material
human body.  In a sense, we are an <span class="ignored">$x$</span> that's controlling seeing through
the sensors of this body, which is why we feel that we have a point of
experience.</p>

<h3 id="1.2"><a class="hindex" href="#1.2">1.2.</a> my thoughts on freewill</h3>

<p>If we look at how machines react based on observations, from the
perspective of physics standard model, we could say that there is no source
of unpredictability (i.e. no choice) except if <em>quantum randomness</em> is
real.  So, I think, for an observer in this universe, our freewill (if a
thing) comes from quantum randomness.</p>

<p>If there is no such a thing as quantum randomness, then we are effectively
saying that everything is explainable as a reaction to a previous action,
with no new decisions to be made, as everything is already decided by
previous actions.  Therefore, freewill necessarily requires quantum
randomness to be true.</p>

<p>If we analyse <em>randomness</em>, fundamentally, it is essentially when we fail
to explain an outcome due to us lacking information.  Such lack of
information could possibly be due to our ignorance of the laws of the
universe, or be due to the <em>source</em> of it being outside of what we can
observe in this material universe.</p>

<h3 id="1.3"><a class="hindex" href="#1.3">1.3.</a> how might consciousness relate to freewill</h3>

<p>Once <span class="ignored">$x$</span> attaches to the particles that make up our body), <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is able to
read our sensory data and feel it from its view (hence we get the point of
view).</p>

<p>Then, <span class="ignored">$x$</span> could manipulate the particles in our body to behave in some way,
to cause us to react to some events in ways that <span class="ignored">$x$</span> wants.  Here, we can
think that <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is the source of our freewill.</p>

<p>Since <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is not observable by our sensors, all we can see is some
unexplained randomness at the quantum level.</p>

<p>This way, we can see the idea of <span class="ignored">$x$</span> and freewill can be consistent, and
offer an explanation on why we might have a seemingly <em>absolute</em>
randomness at the quantum scale.</p>

<p>In other words, introducing <span class="ignored">$x$</span> as a fundamental particle can explain:
- Why we experience having a point of experience (consciousness).
- Why we might have freewill.
- Why we might be unable to explain at least part of the quantum randomness
  (because it is the freewill of <span class="ignored">$x$</span> manipulating our particles to make our
  material body react to events that <span class="ignored">$x$</span> has observed by getting attached
  to our material sensors).</p>

<h3 id="1.4"><a class="hindex" href="#1.4">1.4.</a> does AI have consciousness?</h3>

<p>It might if it gets an <span class="ignored">$x$</span> attached to it.  But since we are unable to
observe <span class="ignored">$x$</span> by our material sensors, we might never know, as all the output
behaviour that we observe from <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is what appears to us as quantum
randomness.</p>

<p>Can we design a physical experiment to set <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s freewill responses apart from
the other unexplained quantum randomness?  I don't know.</p>

<p>A related concept to this test might be:  does <span class="ignored">$x$</span> behave in a way that
relates to what it observed in the past?  I.e. does <span class="ignored">$x$</span> even have memory?</p>

<p>We know that we feel that we have a memory, and the memory that we feel is
entirely in our material brain.  E.g. if we remove bits of someone's brain,
the person would start to lose his memory as we remove more of his brain
(this is what happens to people with brain strokes).</p>

<p>However, does this mean that <span class="ignored">$x$</span> also lacks a memory?  It is possible that
<span class="ignored">$x$</span> lacks a memory, and that all it used our material organs (mainly
brains' neurons) to store all its memory.</p>

<h3 id="1.5"><a class="hindex" href="#1.5">1.5.</a> a possible relation to simulated universe</h3>

<p><span class="ignored">$x$</span> could be a normal life form with consciousness and freewill in a
different parent universe that got attached to this simulation (our
universe) somehow, and was given control of the particles that make up our
body.</p>

<p>Then, in order to, say, test <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s behaviour in this simulation, it got its
native memory (in the real universe) erased (or disconnected temporarily).
Instead, it was given the ability to build a new memory in the simulation
(the material brain of the body that <span class="ignored">$x$</span> go attached to in this universe).</p>

<p>Why was <span class="ignored">$x$</span> attached to this simulation in this way?  There could be
several reasons, one of which could be that such simulations can be cheaper
and more accurate than the legal system.  For example, maybe <span class="ignored">$x$</span> committed
a crime, and in order to find out whether he is guilty, he got attached to
a simulation of a life similar to the crime scene, that is realistic
enough, in order to test his response.  In order to make the simulation
work as a fair test, <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s memory had to be erased.</p>

<h2 id="what_universe_optimising"><a class="hindex" href="#what_universe_optimising">2.</a> what is the universe optimising?</h2>

<p>We are on the living branch of evolution, billions of years deep since the
<em>Big Bang</em>.  As such, we have received billions of years worth of parameter
tuning to make <em>us</em> like to live more and more.</p>

<p>But who is the <em>us</em>?  Is it me?  You?  Humans?  All animals?  Plants?</p>

<h3 id="maxsurvival"><a class="hindex" href="#maxsurvival">2.1.</a> maximising survival</h3>

<p>To find who is the <em>us</em>, let's look at natural selection's survival
maximisation:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$$</span></p>

<p>Where, for any living organism <span class="ignored">$i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$</span>, <span class="ignored">$s_i$</span> is the total number of
seconds <span class="ignored">$i$</span> lives.</p>

<p>That's all what survival maximisation is doing.  The universe doesn't care
who is <em>us</em>.  The <em>us</em> could be anything.  Humans may not be the end goal,
but might be mere tools to lead to yet another living organism, such as
inter-galactic robots, that can maximise that can maximise <span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n
s_i$</span> real good.</p>

<p>There are two commonly discussed schools of thoughts to maximise
<span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Maximise quantity only</em> &mdash; make <span class="ignored">$n$</span> grow really large, even if <span class="ignored">$s_i$</span>,
  for any <span class="ignored">$i$</span>, is small.  Rabbits and cockroaches are often used as
  examples for this.</li>
<li> <em>Maximise quality only</em> &mdash; make <span class="ignored">$s_i$</span>, for any <span class="ignored">$i$</span>,  grow really large,
  even if <span class="ignored">$n$</span> is small.  Humans in first world nations are often used as
  examples for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is a contradictory view, as <em>quality</em> is not necessarily
independent of <em>quantity</em>.  In fact, it's rather very common that <em>quality</em>
is achieved by having the right <em>quantity</em> of each ingredient at the right
place.</p>

<h3 id="maxexplore"><a class="hindex" href="#maxexplore">2.2.</a> maximising exploration</h3>

<p>If all what each lifeform <span class="ignored">$i$</span>, for any <span class="ignored">$i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$</span>, did
was just to to sit and blink, then the quantity <span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$</span> will
have an upper bound cap that it won't exceed.  Because such lame life
cannot explore the environment to enhance its survival against upcoming
challenges.</p>

<p>This is why almost all living beings perform some kind of research.  E.g.
ants look around to find better sources of food.  Common apes try to invent
some tools, although not as good as the bi-pedal apes (humans).  Etc.</p>

<p>In other words, based on the laws of physics of this universe, it seems
that in order to maximise <span class="ignored">$\sum_{i=0}^n s_i$</span>, we need not to simply live,
but to actually explore new things.</p>

<p>I.e. it <em>seems</em> that, under the laws of physics of this universe, when
<span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$</span> is maximised, the following is also necessarily
maximised:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$    \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m \Pr\!\left(\text{$e_{i,j}$ will maximise
    $\sum_{i=0}^n s_i$}\right)$$</span></p>

<p>Where <span class="ignored">$e_{i,j}$</span> is the <span class="ignored">$j^{th}$</span> idea that the <span class="ignored">$i^{th}$</span> lifeform explored.</p>

<p>Exploring good ideas (i.e. survival maximising ideas) are better than
otherwise.  This is why it's good to explore physics, while it's bad to
explore, say, drunkiness.</p>

<p id="cite_physgood"><strong><a href="#cite_physgood">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Studying physics is good.</em></p>

<p id="cite_drunkbad"><strong><a href="#cite_drunkbad">Theorem 2.</a></strong> <em>Drunkiness is bad.</em></p>

<h3 id="maxfreedom"><a class="hindex" href="#maxfreedom">2.3.</a> maximising freedom</h3>

<p id="cite_freedom"><strong><a href="#cite_freedom">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>Freedom is the ability to do things.</em></p>

<p id="cite_morefreedom"><strong><a href="#cite_morefreedom">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>More freedom is the ability to do more things per second.</em></p>

<p id="cite_moreforliving"><strong><a href="#cite_moreforliving">Conjecture 1.</a></strong> <em>The living seems to be able to do more things per second than the
     dead.  E.g. a living being, such as a human, could fly all over the
     world, play football and land rovers onto Mars in <span class="ignored">$300,000$</span> years.  On
     the other hand, a dead being, such as a rock, is spending millions of
     years just sitting there.</em></p>

<p> <a href="#cite_moreforliving">Conjecture 1</a> implies that in order for to have more freedom, we will
have to be living.  I.e. the more we live, the more things we can do (i.e.
more freedom).</p>

<p>We already know from  <a href="#maxexplore">Section 2.2</a> that survival maximisation necessarily
implies exploring good science.</p>

<p>Therefore, we now know that these three <em>have</em> to be maximised together
(i.e. one cannot be maximised while not maximising the other), as they're
all essentially synonyms of some kind:</p>

<ul>
<li> Survival maximisation.</li>
<li> Exploration maximisation.</li>
<li> Freedom maximisation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slavery"><a class="hindex" href="#slavery">2.4.</a> slavery</h3>

<p id="cite_slavery"><strong><a href="#cite_slavery">Definition 3.</a></strong> <em>Slavery is that which reduces freedom.</em></p>

<p>By  <a href="#cite_drunkbad">Theorem 2</a>,  <a href="#cite_freedom">Definition 1</a> and  <a href="#cite_slavery">Definition 3</a>,  <a href="#cite_drunkinessisslavery">Theorem 3</a> is deduced.</p>

<p id="cite_drunkinessisslavery"><strong><a href="#cite_drunkinessisslavery">Theorem 3.</a></strong> <em>Promoting drunkiness is promoting slavery.</em></p>

<p>So, next time someonne tells you that he/she/xe is just being <em>free</em> for
getting drunk, you tell them: &ldquo;Nope!   <a href="#cite_drunkinessisslavery">Theorem 3</a> has actually
proven that you're rather choosing slavery!&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="corona_economy"><a class="hindex" href="#corona_economy">4.</a> corona economy</h2>

<p>The coronavirus economy demonstrates that my theory on <em>perfect money</em> is
right.  Here is how:</p>

<ul>
<li> Economies reliant on luxury (e.g. tourism, fancy cars, etc) are net-negative
  as per my <em>perfect money</em> theory, and logic dictates that <em>asymptotically</em>
  as such is doomed to be net-negative in the long run (sooner or later).
  These economies are also attacked most by coronavirus!</li>
<li> Economies reliant on practically useful things (practical food, practical
  delivery, etc) are net-positive by my <em>perfect money</em> theory.  Guess what?
  These are affected least by coronavirus.  In some cases their profits
  increased.  In cases where their profits lowered as <em>necessarily</em> because of
  them operating in a bigger luxurious economy (e.g. some practical food makers
  existing in a city that gets its revenue largely by luxurious economics such
  as tourism</li>
</ul>
<p>Lesson learned:  </p>

<ul>
<li> Never invest in luxurious economies as they are asymptotically net-negative
  and a timed bomb.</li>
<li> If you think to invest in a luxurious economy, with the plan to sell it to
  some victim right before it collapses, then this is unethical and goes under
  various bad things, such as:<ul>
<li> Drug dealing.</li>
<li> Crab mentality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Societies that contain such selfish people are doomed to progress at a slower
pace.  So I can't stress enough how <em>horrible</em> this is as an investment
opportunity.  Only a blind would oversee such dangers.</p>
