<h2 id="imo_music_not_good"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good">1.</a> imo music is not good</h2>

<p>Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:</p>

<ul>
<li> That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.  Now the next question is:</p>

<p id="cite_whyneedmusic"><strong><a href="#cite_whyneedmusic">Question 1.</a></strong> <em>Why do you need that information?</em></p>

<p>and its answer:</p>

<p id="cite_studyingretards"><strong><a href="#cite_studyingretards">Answer 1.</a></strong> <em>Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.</em></p>

<p>So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!</p>

<p>Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> Weakens your ear drums.</li>
<li> Induces bias to your brain's activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <em>drums</em> damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.</p>

<p>But what do I mean by the <em>bias</em> shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in  <a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_biasvariance" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Some shooting targets showing the bias-variance trade-off." src="https://cave.mn/pics/bias-variance-tradeoff.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 1.</a></strong> Bias-variance trade-off.</figcaption></figure>

<p>IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.</p>

<p>IMO nothing is wrong with  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> statement in  <a href="#cite_occamsrazorquote">Quote 3</a>, so I
agree with it.</p>

<figure id="cite_occamsrazorquote"><strong><a href="#cite_occamsrazorquote">Quote 3:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;More things should not be used than are necessary&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>William of Ockham, 14th century</cite></footer></figure>

<h3 id="imo_occams_razor_is_abused.notabused"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.notabused">2.1.</a> a case where  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> is <em>not</em> abused</h3>

<p>Before I show you how  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> is abused, let me show you a case
where it is not abused.</p>

<p>Suppose that we want to predict how far would a 100kg stone travel after being
thrown by a catapult.  Then, someone proposes function
<span class="ignored">$$f : x_1,_2,\ldots,x_n \to [0, \infty]$$</span>
where <span class="ignored">$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$</span> are some input numbers that quantify things, such as
stone's mass, stone's shape, length of the catapult's arm, amount of force that
moves the arm, etc.</p>

<p>Suppose that <span class="ignored">$f$</span> is pretty accurate in predicting how far the stone would
travel, with an error that follows the normal distribution <span class="ignored">$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$</span>.</p>

<p>Nice, right?  So now we can use the function <span class="ignored">$f$</span>, feed it with input, and
pretty accurately get where the projectile would land.</p>

<p>But now imagine some other dude found that the <span class="ignored">$n^{th}$</span> input of <span class="ignored">$f$</span> was not
needed, so he came up with another function
<span class="ignored">$$g : x_1,_2,\ldots,x_{n-1} \to [0, \infty]$$</span>
that needs 1 less input (no need for <span class="ignored">$x_n$</span>), and is also exactly as accurate
with an error that follows the same normal distribution <span class="ignored">$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$</span>.</p>

<p>As you see, the utility of <span class="ignored">$f$</span> is exactly identical to <span class="ignored">$g$</span>'s, and hence the
extra complexity of <span class="ignored">$f$</span> due to it needing <span class="ignored">$n$</span> many arguments (instead of <span class="ignored">$n-1$</span>
as in <span class="ignored">$g$</span>), is <em>unnecessary</em> complexity.</p>

<p>Hence, we can rightfully conclude that <span class="ignored">$g$</span> is a better model in explaining the
phenomenon than <span class="ignored">$f$</span>.</p>

<h3 id="imo_occams_razor_is_abused.abused"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.abused">2.2.</a> a case where  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> <em>is</em> abused</h3>

<p>What if I tell you that, while <span class="ignored">$f$</span> needs an extra argument that <span class="ignored">$g$</span> does not
need:</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class="ignored">$f$</span> is <em>much faster</em> when implemented in a computer, which allows calculating
  catapult's expected accuracy much faster in field, hence increasing its fire
  rate.</li>
<li> The extra argument that only <span class="ignored">$f$</span> needs, i.e. <span class="ignored">$x_n$</span>, is a constant specific to
  the catapult, and is easy to obtain.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, <span class="ignored">$f$</span>'s extra arguments is suddenly <em>not</em> unnecessary any more
because the extra argument allows to increase the <em>utility</em> of <span class="ignored">$f$</span> in a
scenario that we care about.  Therefore, IMO using  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> here to reject
<span class="ignored">$f$</span> is wrong.</p>

<p>See, <em>utility</em> is important.  If more things increase a thing's utility, then
those more things are no longer <em>unnecessary</em>, and hence  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> does not
apply to them.</p>

<p><em>Utility</em> depends on the domain/scenario.  E.g. in the scenario of
 <a href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.notabused">Section 2.1</a> <span class="ignored">$f$</span>'s more things is unnecessary, and
hence  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> applies to eliminate <span class="ignored">$f$</span>.  But in this section's scenario
<span class="ignored">$f$</span>'s more things is not unnecessary and hence  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a> does not apply.</p>

<h3 id="imo_occams_razor_is_abused.isGodnoneed"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.isGodnoneed">2.3.</a> is believe in God unnecessary?</h3>

<p>I agree that, say, physics' models probably don't need believe in God.  E.g. if
you give me an equation to model <em>gravity</em> that somehow incorporates <em>believe
in God</em> into it, then most likely your model has a unnecessary complexity over
the existing physics model for gravity, which lacks believe in God.</p>

<p>But does this mean that, <em>in all scenarios</em>, believe in God is an unnecessary
addition?  Simply because adding believe in God in some models, such as
physic's models for gravity, is unnecessary, it does not mean that believe in
God is unnecessary in virtually every other scenario.</p>

<p>E.g. <span class="ignored">$f$</span> is not virtually unnecessary in all scenarios.  <span class="ignored">$f$</span> was only
unnecessary in  <a href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.notabused">Section 2.1</a>'s scenario, but it was
totally necessary in  <a href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.abused">Section 2.2</a>'s scenario.</p>

<p>Therefore, if any person claims that <em>&ldquo;believe in God is unnecessary.
Period!&rdquo;</em>, then that person <em>must</em> prove that there is virtually no scenario
at all where believe in God has any utility.</p>

<p>I have never seen any person manage to back the claim that &ldquo;<em>there is no
scenario where God is necessary</em>&rdquo;.  Therefore, by the same sciencey stuff they
claim they like, I hereby call their claims <em>unsubstantiated</em>.</p>

<h3 id="imo_occams_razor_is_abused.4"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.4">2.4.</a> proof that believe in God is necessary</h3>

<p> <a href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.isGodnoneed">Section 2.3</a> showed how the claim &ldquo;<em>believe in God
is unnecessary</em>&rdquo; is actually <em>unsubstantiated</em>.  In <em>this</em> section, I will
take it further by showing you that it is actually  <em>false</em>.</p>

<p id="cite_believeGodnecessary"><strong><a href="#cite_believeGodnecessary">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Believe in God is necessary.</em></p>

<h4 id="imo_occams_razor_is_abused.4.1"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_occams_razor_is_abused.4.1">2.4.1.</a>  <a href="#cite_believeGodnecessary">Theorem 1</a>'s proof</h4>

<p>First let's define some basic tools<sup><a href="#fn___7">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p id="cite_necessary"><strong><a href="#cite_necessary">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>For a thing <span class="ignored">$a$</span> to be necessary, there must be a senario <span class="ignored">$s$</span> where
             <span class="ignored">$a$</span> has maximum utility over its alternative things.</em></p>

<p id="cite_utility"><strong><a href="#cite_utility">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>For any scenario <span class="ignored">$s$</span>, and for any pair of things <span class="ignored">$a$</span> and <span class="ignored">$b$</span>,
             <span class="ignored">$a$</span>'s utility is more than <span class="ignored">$b$</span>'s in scenario <span class="ignored">$s$</span>, if and only if
             <span class="ignored">$a$</span> achieves the goal of <span class="ignored">$s$</span> better than <span class="ignored">$b$</span>.</em></p>

<p id="cite_goal"><strong><a href="#cite_goal">Axiom 1.</a></strong> <em>Our goal in reality/nature is to maximize what is good.</em></p>

<p id="cite_good"><strong><a href="#cite_good">Definition 3.</a></strong> <em>A thing is good if it maximizes our survivability.
              <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">Click here</a> for more info about this definition.</em></p>

<p>In order to prove  <a href="#cite_believeGodnecessary">Theorem 1</a>, all we need to do is to show that
there exists a scenario <span class="ignored">$s$</span> where believe in God has a higher utility than
otherwise.</p>

<p>Below is a list of scenarios where believe in God results in a higher
survivability of its followers (one is enough, but I show more):</p>

<ul>
<li> Statistics show that  <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4085758/Experts-reveal-sexual-partners-ve-determine-likely-DIVORCE.html">those who commit fornication
  increase their divorce risk by more than the double</a>.<p>Logically, it's no brainer to see that more divorce implies more kids that
  are raised by single-parents.  Statistics show that
   <a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20030123/absent-parent-doubles-child-suicide-risk#1">single-parented children are more than <em>twice</em> as likely to
  commit suicide</a>.</p>

<p>As you know, Abrahamic religions forbid sin, and therefore this is a scenario
  where believing in the Abrahamic God results in saving some lives, aka
  maximizing the survivability.</p>

<p>You may say, but what if parents never get married?  Well, stats show that
  they have even higher separation/dumping rate.  So.. really, the best way for
  your children is a proper Abrahamic marriage.</p>

</li>
<li>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-lgbt-teen-suicide/lgbt-youth-at-higher-risk-for-suicide-attempts-idUSKCN1MI1SL">LGBTs have increased suicide risk</a>.  Obviously Abrahaic
  religions are against this faggy shit, and hence believing in the Abrahamic
  God helps saving lives (aka increasing survivability).
</li>
<li>  <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/belief-in-hell-lowers-cri_n_1609247.html">Believe in hell lowers the crime rate</a>.  Obviously, another
  property of Abrahaic religion is hell.  This is why I also personally think
  &ldquo;<em>hell</em>&rdquo; is a mercy, as it lowers all kinds of crime rate including
  homicide.  For those who complain about the Abrahamic God for having hell,
  think again.
</li>
<li> Believe in God extends our optimization scope, which allows us to
  be more likely to invest in <em>good</em> very long-term projects that non-believers
  won' &mdash; for more info  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/4/#God_extends_optimization_scope">read this</a>.
</li>
<li> I can pull more, but I got tired.  So let's stop here.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I don't know any general statistics that show that
believe in the Abrahamic God is harmful.  You might be thinking of ISIS, or
religious wars.  But I have two points for you:</p>

<ul>
<li> ISIS exists in a proxy war situation and receives foreign funds, plus they
  themselves violate Abrahamic teachings as they kill innocents, even by
  Quranic standards.</li>
<li> In the history of all wars,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war">religious wars make up <em>only</em>
  6.97% of them</a>.  Meaning, non-religiousness resulted in much more wars.
  Meaning, religiousness correlate with reduced wars.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO it should be very clear that believe in the Abrahamic God increases our
survivability.  Then:</p>

<ol>
<li> By  <a href="#cite_good">Definition 3</a> we can see that believe in the Abrahamic God is <em>good</em>.</li>
<li> By  <a href="#cite_goal">Axiom 1</a> we can see that believe in the Abrahamic God allows us to meet <em>our
  goal</em> better</li>
<li> By  <a href="#cite_utility">Definition 2</a> we can see that there is at least a scenario <span class="ignored">$s$</span> where believe
  in the Abrahamic God has <em>more utility</em> than otherwise.</li>
<li> By  <a href="#cite_necessary">Definition 1</a> we can see that believe in the Abrahamic God is necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Q.E.D.</p>

<ul style="list-style:none;padding:0; margin:0;"><li id="fn___7"><small>1. IMO the tools are pretty fair and you
shouldn't face much unease accepting them.</small></li>

<h2 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting">3.</a> thoughts on majority voting</h2>

<p>Majority voting &mdash;the backbone of democracy&mdash; has several flaws, but this is
what <em>really</em> bothers me:</p>

<p id="cite_majvotingsucks"><strong><a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1.</a></strong> <em><em>Ideally</em><sup><a href="#fn___8">2</a></sup>, when the voters are any from the entire
           population, the majority of voters are non-experts on the subject
           that they are voting on.</em></p>

<p>I think it's obvious why  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a> is probably true by looking at the
past.  E.g. British ppl who voted on Brexit were mostly non-experts in economy
nor politics.  So I think  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a> is a fair conjecture.</p>

<p> <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a> is very bothering, because it says that the best thing you
could get out of majority voting is some mediocre average <em>shit</em>.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.please"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.please">3.1.</a> what's its goal?</h3>

<p>But if it's so bad, why do many govs use it?  Are they simply dumb and they
can't see what a <em>caveman</em> saw?  I doubt.  Are they smart, but there is another
motive behind majority-voting?  But if you have a peaceful population, then no
need for majority voting IMO.</p>

<p>IMO  <a href="#cite_majvotinggood">Conjecture 2</a> shows the only reason majority voting is appealing.  I.e.
it's a good method for reducing riots, which can eventually save <em>a lot</em> of
money if you have a badass population that may riot any time.</p>

<p id="cite_majvotinggood"><strong><a href="#cite_majvotinggood">Conjecture 2.</a></strong> <em>Majority voting guarantees that the majority of the population are
           happy about the decision.</em></p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.othergoal"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.othergoal">3.2.</a> how about other goals?</h3>

<p>What if, instead of aiming to please most people (majority-voting's aim), our
goal was to rather find <em>the best</em> decision?  I don't think majority voting is
it (due to  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a>).  What I think is it<sup><a href="#fn___9">3</a></sup>, is the following method:</p>

<ol>
<li> Agree on the definition of what is <em>good</em>.  I suggest  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">this definition
   of good</a>.</li>
<li> Choose/perform the decision that has maximum expected <em>good</em>.</li>
<li> If someone wishes to change something, that someone would need to present
  evidence that his change is <em>more good</em> than the existing something.</li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't matter if it's 1 person, or 1 billion people, who want the change.
What matters is only to present evidence that shows that a change is <em>more
good</em>.</p>

<p>But obviously, soon, we will end up seeing ppl abusing sources of evidence.
E.g. if statistics is the source, then we will see ppl generating false
statistics and claiming that they are legit, while they aren't.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.3"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.3">3.3.</a> what's happening in reality?</h3>

<p>IMO, in reality, in <em>nice</em> democratic countries, this is what's happening:</p>

<ol>
<li> Majority voting is used to calm idiots so they don't riot in streets.  They
  only elect a symbolic figure, like a president &mdash;
   <a href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.please">Section 3.1</a>.</li>
<li> The real decisions are actually done by experts in their domains (e.g. game
  theorists, logicians, statisticians, etc) behind closed doors &mdash;
   <a href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.othergoal">Section 3.2</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In <em>nice</em> dictatorship countries, this is what's happening:</p>

<ol>
<li> The real decisions are actually done by experts in their domains (e.g. game
  theorists, logicians, statisticians, etc) behind closed doors &mdash;
   <a href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.othergoal">Section 3.2</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, nice dictatorship is more efficient than nice democracy as the
former doesn't need to waste resources to run the votes.</p>

<p>Which is of course not a surprise that a nice dictatorship is better than a
nice democracy.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.4"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.4">3.4.</a> democracy vs. dictatorship</h3>

<p>Which approach is more likely to produce a nice system: Democracy? Or
dictatorship?  IMO <em>dictatorship</em>, because:</p>

<ul>
<li> Most 1st world countries seem to collect votes only to calm their population.
  E.g. Brexit.  So in practice hardly any one runs democracy any way (which is
  good, IMO).</li>
<li> Dictatorship is not <em>entirely</em> dictatorship.  It's rather <em>election by
  natural selection</em>, which IMO is <em>the ultimate form of voting</em>, which IMO
  directly rewards what is <em>good</em> as per  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">my definition of good</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, democracy is also bound by natural selection, which is why I think
it <em>mostly</em> got extinct in practice due to  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a>.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.5"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.5">3.5.</a> will voting always work?</h3>

<p>In  <a href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.please">Section 3.1</a> is said that majority voting is good to
calm people, and hence save money that would be otherwise spent on riot
control.  In this section I ask the question: <em>will it always work?</em></p>

<p>My answer: <em>IMO no</em>.  My justification:  at some point people will eventually
learn that it's a fake play to calm the majority.  At this point, it will no
longer be effective, as people will know that their voice are actually
<em>uheard</em>.</p>

<p>IMO, <em>voting</em> is either a bad idea (see  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a>), or a lie to avoid
riots.  In the case of the former, it's getting extinct by natural selection.
In the case of the latter, IMO it goes under <em>lies don't sustain</em> like any
<em>win-lose</em> relationship.</p>
