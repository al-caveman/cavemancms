<h2 id="corona_economy"><a class="hindex" href="#corona_economy">2.</a> corona economy</h2>

<p>The coronavirus economy demonstrates that my theory on <em>perfect money</em> is
right.  Here is how:</p>

<ul>
<li> Economies reliant on luxury (e.g. tourism, fancy cars, etc) are net-negative
  as per my <em>perfect money</em> theory, and logic dictates that <em>asymptotically</em>
  as such is doomed to be net-negative in the long run (sooner or later).
  These economies are also attacked most by coronavirus!</li>
<li> Economies reliant on practically useful things (practical food, practical
  delivery, etc) are net-positive by my <em>perfect money</em> theory.  Guess what?
  These are affected least by coronavirus.  In some cases their profits
  increased.  In cases where their profits lowered as <em>necessarily</em> because of
  them operating in a bigger luxurious economy (e.g. some practical food makers
  existing in a city that gets its revenue largely by luxurious economics such
  as tourism</li>
</ul>
<p>Lesson learned:  </p>

<ul>
<li> Never invest in luxurious economies as they are asymptotically net-negative
  and a timed bomb.</li>
<li> If you think to invest in a luxurious economy, with the plan to sell it to
  some victim right before it collapses, then this is unethical and goes under
  various bad things, such as:<ul>
<li> Drug dealing.</li>
<li> Crab mentality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Societies that contain such selfish people are doomed to progress at a slower
pace.  So I can't stress enough how <em>horrible</em> this is as an investment
opportunity.  Only a blind would oversee such dangers.</p>

<h2 id="perfect_money"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money">3.</a> perfect money</h2>

<h3 id="perfect_money.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money.1">3.1.</a> mistakes with today's money</h3>

<p>You sold a sandwich to person <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span>, and another identical sandwich to person
<span class="ignored">$p_2$</span>.  With the current monetary system, you'd usually charge <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> and <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span>
by the goods that you gave them, not by who they are or what they did with it.
So you'd charge them, say, <span class="ignored">$10$</span> bucks each.</p>

<p>But, a question is: what if person <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> used that sandwich to energize himself
to discover (or invent) good science that would save the lives of millions,
while <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> simply used that sandwich to sit on ass and watch TV &mdash; is the
worth of both your efforts at giving them sandwiches equivalent?</p>

<p>The current monetary system assumes that <em>yes</em>, both of your sandwiches, are
equivalent regardless of the fact that they have lead into different outcomes:
sandwich eaten by <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> resulted in science that saved lives, while sandwich
eaten by <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> resulted in only increasing the net carbon emission.</p>

<p id="cite_equal_worth"><strong><a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1.</a></strong> <em>Today's monetary system ignores the results lead to by an effort or work.</em></p>

<p>There is no proof that shows that  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is optimal.  In fact, we can
easily see that it is wrong as soon as we start choosing a goal.  E.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li> If we choose our goal to be to maximize our GDP, then  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is
  obviously wrong, since sandwich given to <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> did not result in anything
  useful to the economy (<span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> just used it to sit on ass watch TV), while
  sandwich given to <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> resulted in a major progress that would most likely
  boost the GDP.</li>
<li> If we choose our goal to be to advance our civilization so that it gets
  closer immortality, then  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is still wrong for the same obvious
  reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as you see, there are many reasons why  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is totally wrong.</p>

<p> <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> also implies that the current monetary system assumes that the
worth of works in the past is <em>frozen</em>.  E.g. what if it turned out after, say,
<span class="ignored">$5$</span> years that person <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span>'s discovered science was actually  harmful to the
progress of our civilization?  The current monetary system will assume that
sandwich given to <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> it is still worth <span class="ignored">$10$</span> bucks, which is not true (since
it turned out <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> put the sandwich to harmful use).</p>

<h3 id="perfect_money.2"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money.2">3.2.</a> perfect money</h3>

<p id="cite_perfect_money"><strong><a href="#cite_perfect_money">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Amount of money <span class="ignored">$m$</span>, given to work <span class="ignored">$w$</span> (e.g. selling sandwich) which
resulted in outcome <span class="ignored">$o$</span>, is said to be perfect, if <span class="ignored">$m$</span> equals the total number
of seconds reduced in our journey towards becoming an immortal civilization
according to hypothesis <span class="ignored">$h'$</span>, thanks <span class="ignored">$w$</span>'s fair share contribution of allowing
<span class="ignored">$o$</span> to happen.</em></p>

<p>In other words, money <span class="ignored">$m$</span> is rather a value mapped to a function:
<span class="ignored">$$m = \text{t}(w, o, h')$$</span>
where <span class="ignored">$t$</span> is a function that maps work <span class="ignored">$w$</span> that lead to outcome <span class="ignored">$o$</span> to the
total number of seconds reduced in our journey towards the nearest immortal
civilization, by using the hypothesis <span class="ignored">$h'$</span>.  <span class="ignored">$h'$</span> is our best estimation to
model reality and gets updated over time.</p>

<p>So, in other words, the unit of the perfect money is measured in <em>metric
seconds</em>.  That is, International System of Unit (SI) unit of money must be
<em>seconds</em>.  Isn't this fascinating?</p>

<h4 id="perfect_money.2.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money.2.1">3.2.1.</a> proof</h4>

<p>We only need to prove that the best goal to have is the goal of reaching an
immortal civilization.  For this, we need a few axioms:</p>

<p id="cite_evo"><strong><a href="#cite_evo">Axiom 1.</a></strong> <em>Evolution is true.</em></p>

<p id="cite_freedom"><strong><a href="#cite_freedom">Axiom 2.</a></strong> <em>The superset of freedoms is better than its strict subset.</em></p>

<p id="cite_life"><strong><a href="#cite_life">Axiom 3.</a></strong> <em>The set of freedom's available while being alive is the superset of the
      set of freedoms available when dead.</em></p>

<p id="cite_causeeffect"><strong><a href="#cite_causeeffect">Axiom 4.</a></strong> <em>When causality is unknown, assume the most accurate available statistical
      correlation.</em></p>

<p>Then those axioms will lead to that our goal in <em>life</em> (in general) is to
maximize survival of life forms in general (not only humans).  And the only
known way to maximize that is by achieving an immortal civilization.
Everything (including feelings) is therefore only a randomized approximation of
a solution to maximize the survival of life forms.  Asymptotically our
happiness is defined after this.  This also solves morality paradoxes.</p>

<p>The proof is easy, but a bit lengthy.  So I'll omit it for now.  Maybe I'll be
more explicit in another time (even tho I think it's easy for your to prove it
yourself).</p>

<h2 id="perfect_food"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food">6.</a> perfect food</h2>

<p><em>Synopsis&mdash;</em>Basically, a food is <em>perfect</em>, if and only if, it is the cheapest
thing that offers you the nutritions that you require.  Else, you are wasting
your money.</p>

<p>As a result, pizza, for example, is clearly not perfect, but rather a waste,
because <em>think</em>:  do you really think the process of making a pizza slice is
the cheapest way to get 285 calories, 12g protein, 10g fat, and 36g carbs?</p>

<p>Think of the operation cost of pizza making, which requires running an oven and
baking.  Imagine the energy bill, and time needed.  Clearly pizza is a wasteful
way of creating nutritional values, as there are many ways we can optimize the
process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could get what a pizza slice would give you, by simply
frying some egg, with cheese, and potatoes, for example, at a cheaper price
point.  I'm not saying that this is perfect either, but it suffices to show you
that pizza is <em>clearly</em> a waste as it is very easy to think of the same
(nutritional value-wise) at a cheaper price point.</p>

<p>But people buy pizza coz they think it's <em>sounds crunchy</em> when you eat it.
F*ck that nonsense.  There is no nutrition in <em>crunch</em>.  This makes pizza a
form of drug that creates artificial need (by the allure of its crunch and
smell) to cause people to make the irrational decision of buying it.</p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.1">6.1.</a> i'm smart</h3>

<p>Say that <span class="ignored">$\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n\}$</span> is the set of all foods.
For example, <span class="ignored">$f_1$</span> could be fried chicken breast, <span class="ignored">$f_2$</span> could be orange, etc.</p>

<p>Also say that for any food <span class="ignored">$f_i \in \mathcal{F}$</span>, <span class="ignored">$c_i$</span> is the cost of <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span>
(i.e. money and time needed to be spent in order to get <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span> into ur belly),
and <span class="ignored">$n_i$</span> is the nutritional values that your body obtains after eating <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span>.</p>

<p>Then, if your body needs nutritional values in interval <span class="ignored">$[n_a, n_b]$</span> (for
whatever health goal you have), then:</p>

<p id="cite_perfectfood"><strong><a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>Food <span class="ignored">$f_i \in \mathcal{F}$</span> is said to be perfect, if and only if:
            <span class="ignored">$$                n_a \le n_i \le n_b
            $$</span>
           and, for all <span class="ignored">$f_j \in \{f_l \in \mathcal{F} : n_a \le n_l \le n_b\}$</span>:
            <span class="ignored">$$            c_i \le c_j
            $$</span></em></p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.2"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.2">6.2.</a> wat if food fails to meet  <a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 1</a>?</h3>

<p>Well, then it's a waste of money.  Period.  Could be a little waste to you,
depending on how spoiled you are, but it remains a waste nonetheless, and you
will be at a loss.</p>

<p>Today's food is mostly heavily a waste of money as they fail to meet
 <a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 1</a>.  Sadly, the concept of <em>food</em> &mdash;today&mdash; is looked from the
view of taste and joy, very similar to how drugs are looked at.</p>

<p>Therefore, it's fair to say that today's food industry has morphed into a fork
of the drug industry, where unnecessary additives are added to lure people in
in order to take maximum money.  It is no longer <em>only</em> nutritional.  It is now
<em>partly</em> nutritional, and <em>partly</em> wasteful to fool idiots to get a slice of
their money (almost everyone on this planet).</p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.3"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.3">6.3.</a> now wat?</h3>

<p>We need to find a principled methodology to objectively guide us on the process
of creating perfect food.   I will keep you updated when I nail this.  Plz stay
tuned.</p>
