<h2 id="what_universe_optimising"><a class="hindex" href="#what_universe_optimising">1.</a> what is the universe optimising?</h2>

<p>We are on the living branch of evolution, billions of years deep since the
<em>Big Bang</em>.  As such, we have received billions of years worth of parameter
tuning to make <em>us</em> like to live more and more.</p>

<p>But who is the <em>us</em>?  Is it me?  You?  Humans?  All animals?  Plants?</p>

<h3 id="maxsurvival"><a class="hindex" href="#maxsurvival">1.1.</a> maximising survival</h3>

<p>To find who is the <em>us</em>, let's look at natural selection's survival
maximisation:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$$</span></p>

<p>Where, for any living organism <span class="ignored">$i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$</span>, <span class="ignored">$s_i$</span> is the total number of
seconds <span class="ignored">$i$</span> lives.</p>

<p>That's all what survival maximisation is doing.  The universe doesn't care
who is <em>us</em>.  The <em>us</em> could be anything.  Humans may not be the end goal,
but might be mere tools to lead to yet another living organism, such as
inter-galactic robots, that can maximise that can maximise <span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n
s_i$</span> real good.</p>

<p>There are two commonly discussed schools of thoughts to maximise
<span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Maximise quantity only</em> &mdash; make <span class="ignored">$n$</span> grow really large, even if <span class="ignored">$s_i$</span>,
  for any <span class="ignored">$i$</span>, is small.  Rabbits and cockroaches are often used as
  examples for this.</li>
<li> <em>Maximise quality only</em> &mdash; make <span class="ignored">$s_i$</span>, for any <span class="ignored">$i$</span>,  grow really large,
  even if <span class="ignored">$n$</span> is small.  Humans in first world nations are often used as
  examples for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is a contradictory view, as <em>quality</em> is not necessarily
independent of <em>quantity</em>.  In fact, it's rather very common that <em>quality</em>
is achieved by having the right <em>quantity</em> of each ingredient at the right
place.</p>

<h3 id="maxexplore"><a class="hindex" href="#maxexplore">1.2.</a> maximising exploration</h3>

<p>If all what each lifeform <span class="ignored">$i$</span>, for any <span class="ignored">$i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$</span>, did
was just to to sit and blink, then the quantity <span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$</span> will
have an upper bound cap that it won't exceed.  Because such lame life
cannot explore the environment to enhance its survival against upcoming
challenges.</p>

<p>This is why almost all living beings perform some kind of research.  E.g.
ants look around to find better sources of food.  Common apes try to invent
some tools, although not as good as the bi-pedal apes (humans).  Etc.</p>

<p>In other words, based on the laws of physics of this universe, it seems
that in order to maximise <span class="ignored">$\sum_{i=0}^n s_i$</span>, we need not to simply live,
but to actually explore new things.</p>

<p>I.e. it <em>seems</em> that, under the laws of physics of this universe, when
<span class="ignored">$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$</span> is maximised, the following is also necessarily
maximised:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$    \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m \Pr\!\left(\text{$e_{i,j}$ will maximise
    $\sum_{i=0}^n s_i$}\right)$$</span></p>

<p>Where <span class="ignored">$e_{i,j}$</span> is the <span class="ignored">$j^{th}$</span> idea that the <span class="ignored">$i^{th}$</span> lifeform explored.</p>

<p>Exploring good ideas (i.e. survival maximising ideas) are better than
otherwise.  This is why it's good to explore physics, while it's bad to
explore, say, drunkiness.</p>

<p id="cite_physgood"><strong><a href="#cite_physgood">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Studying physics is good.</em></p>

<p id="cite_drunkbad"><strong><a href="#cite_drunkbad">Theorem 2.</a></strong> <em>Drunkiness is bad.</em></p>

<h3 id="maxfreedom"><a class="hindex" href="#maxfreedom">1.3.</a> maximising freedom</h3>

<p id="cite_freedom"><strong><a href="#cite_freedom">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>Freedom is the ability to do things.</em></p>

<p id="cite_morefreedom"><strong><a href="#cite_morefreedom">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>More freedom is the ability to do more things per second.</em></p>

<p id="cite_moreforliving"><strong><a href="#cite_moreforliving">Conjecture 1.</a></strong> <em>The living seems to be able to do more things per second than the
     dead.  E.g. a living being, such as a human, could fly all over the
     world, play football and land rovers onto Mars in <span class="ignored">$300,000$</span> years.  On
     the other hand, a dead being, such as a rock, is spending millions of
     years just sitting there.</em></p>

<p> <a href="#cite_moreforliving">Conjecture 1</a> implies that in order for to have more freedom, we will
have to be living.  I.e. the more we live, the more things we can do (i.e.
more freedom).</p>

<p>We already know from  <a href="#maxexplore">Section 1.2</a> that survival maximisation necessarily
implies exploring good science.</p>

<p>Therefore, we now know that these three <em>have</em> to be maximised together
(i.e. one cannot be maximised while not maximising the other), as they're
all essentially synonyms of some kind:</p>

<ul>
<li> Survival maximisation.</li>
<li> Exploration maximisation.</li>
<li> Freedom maximisation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slavery"><a class="hindex" href="#slavery">1.4.</a> slavery</h3>

<p id="cite_slavery"><strong><a href="#cite_slavery">Definition 3.</a></strong> <em>Slavery is that which reduces freedom.</em></p>

<p>By  <a href="#cite_drunkbad">Theorem 2</a>,  <a href="#cite_freedom">Definition 1</a> and  <a href="#cite_slavery">Definition 3</a>,  <a href="#cite_drunkinessisslavery">Theorem 3</a> is deduced.</p>

<p id="cite_drunkinessisslavery"><strong><a href="#cite_drunkinessisslavery">Theorem 3.</a></strong> <em>Promoting drunkiness is promoting slavery.</em></p>

<p>So, next time someonne tells you that he/she/xe is just being <em>free</em> for
getting drunk, you tell them: &ldquo;Nope!   <a href="#cite_drunkinessisslavery">Theorem 3</a> has actually
proven that you're rather choosing slavery!&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="corona_economy"><a class="hindex" href="#corona_economy">3.</a> corona economy</h2>

<p>The coronavirus economy demonstrates that my theory on <em>perfect money</em> is
right.  Here is how:</p>

<ul>
<li> Economies reliant on luxury (e.g. tourism, fancy cars, etc) are net-negative
  as per my <em>perfect money</em> theory, and logic dictates that <em>asymptotically</em>
  as such is doomed to be net-negative in the long run (sooner or later).
  These economies are also attacked most by coronavirus!</li>
<li> Economies reliant on practically useful things (practical food, practical
  delivery, etc) are net-positive by my <em>perfect money</em> theory.  Guess what?
  These are affected least by coronavirus.  In some cases their profits
  increased.  In cases where their profits lowered as <em>necessarily</em> because of
  them operating in a bigger luxurious economy (e.g. some practical food makers
  existing in a city that gets its revenue largely by luxurious economics such
  as tourism</li>
</ul>
<p>Lesson learned:  </p>

<ul>
<li> Never invest in luxurious economies as they are asymptotically net-negative
  and a timed bomb.</li>
<li> If you think to invest in a luxurious economy, with the plan to sell it to
  some victim right before it collapses, then this is unethical and goes under
  various bad things, such as:<ul>
<li> Drug dealing.</li>
<li> Crab mentality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Societies that contain such selfish people are doomed to progress at a slower
pace.  So I can't stress enough how <em>horrible</em> this is as an investment
opportunity.  Only a blind would oversee such dangers.</p>

<h2 id="perfect_money"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money">4.</a> perfect money</h2>

<h3 id="perfect_money.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money.1">4.1.</a> mistakes with today's money</h3>

<p>You sold a sandwich to person <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span>, and another identical sandwich to person
<span class="ignored">$p_2$</span>.  With the current monetary system, you'd usually charge <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> and <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span>
by the goods that you gave them, not by who they are or what they did with it.
So you'd charge them, say, <span class="ignored">$10$</span> bucks each.</p>

<p>But, a question is: what if person <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> used that sandwich to energize himself
to discover (or invent) good science that would save the lives of millions,
while <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> simply used that sandwich to sit on ass and watch TV &mdash; is the
worth of both your efforts at giving them sandwiches equivalent?</p>

<p>The current monetary system assumes that <em>yes</em>, both of your sandwiches, are
equivalent regardless of the fact that they have lead into different outcomes:
sandwich eaten by <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> resulted in science that saved lives, while sandwich
eaten by <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> resulted in only increasing the net carbon emission.</p>

<p id="cite_equal_worth"><strong><a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1.</a></strong> <em>Today's monetary system ignores the results lead to by an effort or work.</em></p>

<p>There is no proof that shows that  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is optimal.  In fact, we can
easily see that it is wrong as soon as we start choosing a goal.  E.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li> If we choose our goal to be to maximize our GDP, then  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is
  obviously wrong, since sandwich given to <span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> did not result in anything
  useful to the economy (<span class="ignored">$p_2$</span> just used it to sit on ass watch TV), while
  sandwich given to <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> resulted in a major progress that would most likely
  boost the GDP.</li>
<li> If we choose our goal to be to advance our civilization so that it gets
  closer immortality, then  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is still wrong for the same obvious
  reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as you see, there are many reasons why  <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> is totally wrong.</p>

<p> <a href="#cite_equal_worth">Assumption 1</a> also implies that the current monetary system assumes that the
worth of works in the past is <em>frozen</em>.  E.g. what if it turned out after, say,
<span class="ignored">$5$</span> years that person <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span>'s discovered science was actually  harmful to the
progress of our civilization?  The current monetary system will assume that
sandwich given to <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> it is still worth <span class="ignored">$10$</span> bucks, which is not true (since
it turned out <span class="ignored">$p_1$</span> put the sandwich to harmful use).</p>

<h3 id="perfect_money.2"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money.2">4.2.</a> perfect money</h3>

<p id="cite_perfect_money"><strong><a href="#cite_perfect_money">Theorem 4.</a></strong> <em>Amount of money <span class="ignored">$m$</span>, given to work <span class="ignored">$w$</span> (e.g. selling sandwich) which
resulted in outcome <span class="ignored">$o$</span>, is said to be perfect, if <span class="ignored">$m$</span> equals the total number
of seconds reduced in our journey towards becoming an immortal civilization
according to hypothesis <span class="ignored">$h'$</span>, thanks <span class="ignored">$w$</span>'s fair share contribution of allowing
<span class="ignored">$o$</span> to happen.</em></p>

<p>In other words, money <span class="ignored">$m$</span> is rather a value mapped to a function:
<span class="ignored">$$m = \text{t}(w, o, h')$$</span>
where <span class="ignored">$t$</span> is a function that maps work <span class="ignored">$w$</span> that lead to outcome <span class="ignored">$o$</span> to the
total number of seconds reduced in our journey towards the nearest immortal
civilization, by using the hypothesis <span class="ignored">$h'$</span>.  <span class="ignored">$h'$</span> is our best estimation to
model reality and gets updated over time.</p>

<p>So, in other words, the unit of the perfect money is measured in <em>metric
seconds</em>.  That is, International System of Unit (SI) unit of money must be
<em>seconds</em>.  Isn't this fascinating?</p>

<h4 id="perfect_money.2.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_money.2.1">4.2.1.</a> proof</h4>

<p>We only need to prove that the best goal to have is the goal of reaching an
immortal civilization.  For this, we need a few axioms:</p>

<p id="cite_evo"><strong><a href="#cite_evo">Axiom 1.</a></strong> <em>Evolution is true.</em></p>

<p id="cite_life"><strong><a href="#cite_life">Axiom 2.</a></strong> <em>The set of freedom's available while being alive is the superset of the
      set of freedoms available when dead.</em></p>

<p id="cite_causeeffect"><strong><a href="#cite_causeeffect">Axiom 3.</a></strong> <em>When causality is unknown, assume the most accurate available statistical
      correlation.</em></p>

<p>Then those axioms will lead to that our goal in <em>life</em> (in general) is to
maximize survival of life forms in general (not only humans).  And the only
known way to maximize that is by achieving an immortal civilization.
Everything (including feelings) is therefore only a randomized approximation of
a solution to maximize the survival of life forms.  Asymptotically our
happiness is defined after this.  This also solves morality paradoxes.</p>

<p>The proof is easy, but a bit lengthy.  So I'll omit it for now.  Maybe I'll be
more explicit in another time (even tho I think it's easy for your to prove it
yourself).</p>

<h2 id="perfect_food"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food">7.</a> perfect food</h2>

<p><em>Synopsis&mdash;</em>Basically, a food is <em>perfect</em>, if and only if, it is the cheapest
thing that offers you the nutritions that you require.  Else, you are wasting
your money.</p>

<p>As a result, pizza, for example, is clearly not perfect, but rather a waste,
because <em>think</em>:  do you really think the process of making a pizza slice is
the cheapest way to get 285 calories, 12g protein, 10g fat, and 36g carbs?</p>

<p>Think of the operation cost of pizza making, which requires running an oven and
baking.  Imagine the energy bill, and time needed.  Clearly pizza is a wasteful
way of creating nutritional values, as there are many ways we can optimize the
process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could get what a pizza slice would give you, by simply
frying some egg, with cheese, and potatoes, for example, at a cheaper price
point.  I'm not saying that this is perfect either, but it suffices to show you
that pizza is <em>clearly</em> a waste as it is very easy to think of the same
(nutritional value-wise) at a cheaper price point.</p>

<p>But people buy pizza coz they think it's <em>sounds crunchy</em> when you eat it.
F*ck that nonsense.  There is no nutrition in <em>crunch</em>.  This makes pizza a
form of drug that creates artificial need (by the allure of its crunch and
smell) to cause people to make the irrational decision of buying it.</p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.1">7.1.</a> i'm smart</h3>

<p>Say that <span class="ignored">$\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n\}$</span> is the set of all foods.
For example, <span class="ignored">$f_1$</span> could be fried chicken breast, <span class="ignored">$f_2$</span> could be orange, etc.</p>

<p>Also say that for any food <span class="ignored">$f_i \in \mathcal{F}$</span>, <span class="ignored">$c_i$</span> is the cost of <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span>
(i.e. money and time needed to be spent in order to get <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span> into ur belly),
and <span class="ignored">$n_i$</span> is the nutritional values that your body obtains after eating <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span>.</p>

<p>Then, if your body needs nutritional values in interval <span class="ignored">$[n_a, n_b]$</span> (for
whatever health goal you have), then:</p>

<p id="cite_perfectfood"><strong><a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 4.</a></strong> <em>Food <span class="ignored">$f_i \in \mathcal{F}$</span> is said to be perfect, if and only if:
            <span class="ignored">$$                n_a \le n_i \le n_b
            $$</span>
           and, for all <span class="ignored">$f_j \in \{f_l \in \mathcal{F} : n_a \le n_l \le n_b\}$</span>:
            <span class="ignored">$$            c_i \le c_j
            $$</span></em></p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.2"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.2">7.2.</a> wat if food fails to meet  <a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 4</a>?</h3>

<p>Well, then it's a waste of money.  Period.  Could be a little waste to you,
depending on how spoiled you are, but it remains a waste nonetheless, and you
will be at a loss.</p>

<p>Today's food is mostly heavily a waste of money as they fail to meet
 <a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 4</a>.  Sadly, the concept of <em>food</em> &mdash;today&mdash; is looked from the
view of taste and joy, very similar to how drugs are looked at.</p>

<p>Therefore, it's fair to say that today's food industry has morphed into a fork
of the drug industry, where unnecessary additives are added to lure people in
in order to take maximum money.  It is no longer <em>only</em> nutritional.  It is now
<em>partly</em> nutritional, and <em>partly</em> wasteful to fool idiots to get a slice of
their money (almost everyone on this planet).</p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.3"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.3">7.3.</a> now wat?</h3>

<p>We need to find a principled methodology to objectively guide us on the process
of creating perfect food.   I will keep you updated when I nail this.  Plz stay
tuned.</p>
