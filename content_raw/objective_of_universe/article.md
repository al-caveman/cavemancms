slavery

We are on the living branch of evolution, billions of years deep since the
_Big Bang_.  As such, we have received billions of years worth of parameter
tuning to make _us_ like to live more and more.

But who is the _us_?  Is it me?  You?  Humans?  All animals?  Plants?

##maxsurvival maximising survival

To find who is the _us_, let's look at natural selection's survival
maximisation:

$$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$$

Where, for any living organism $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$, $s_i$ is the total number of
seconds $i$ lives.

That's all what survival maximisation is doing.  The universe doesn't care
who is _us_.  The _us_ could be anything.  Humans may not be the end goal,
but might be mere tools to lead to yet another living organism, such as
inter-galactic robots, that can maximise that can maximise $\sum_{l=0}^n
s_i$ real good.

There are two commonly discussed schools of thoughts to maximise
$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$:

* _Maximise quantity only_ --- make $n$ grow really large, even if $s_i$,
  for any $i$, is small.  Rabbits and cockroaches are often used as
  examples for this.
* _Maximise quality only_ --- make $s_i$, for any $i$,  grow really large,
  even if $n$ is small.  Humans in first world nations are often used as
  examples for this.

But this is a contradictory view, as _quality_ is not necessarily
independent of _quantity_.  In fact, it's rather very common that _quality_
is achieved by having the right _quantity_ of each ingredient at the right
place.

##maxexplore maximising exploration

If all what each lifeform $i$, for any $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$, did
was just to to sit and blink, then the quantity $\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$ will
have an upper bound cap that it won't exceed.  Because such lame life
cannot explore the environment to enhance its survival against upcoming
challenges.

This is why almost all living beings perform some kind of research.  E.g.
ants look around to find better sources of food.  Common apes try to invent
some tools, although not as good as the bi-pedal apes (humans).  Etc.

In other words, based on the laws of physics of this universe, it seems
that in order to maximise $\sum_{i=0}^n s_i$, we need not to simply live,
but to actually explore new things.

I.e. it _seems_ that, under the laws of physics of this universe, when
$\sum_{l=0}^n s_i$ is maximised, the following is also necessarily
maximised:

$$
    \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m \Pr\!\left(\text{$e_{i,j}$ will maximise
    $\sum_{i=0}^n s_i$}\right)
$$

Where $e_{i,j}$ is the $j^{th}$ idea that the $i^{th}$ lifeform explored.

Exploring good ideas (i.e. survival maximising ideas) are better than
otherwise.  This is why it's good to explore physics, while it's bad to
explore, say, drunkiness.

##maxfreedom maximising freedom

definition:freedom
text:Freedom is the ability to do things.

definition:morefreedom
text:More freedom is the ability to do more things per second.

conjecture:moreforliving
text:The living seems to be able to do more things per second than the
     dead.  E.g. a living being, such as a human, could fly all over the
     world, play football and land rovers onto Mars in $300,000$ years.  On
     the other hand, a dead being, such as a rock, is spending millions of
     years just sitting there.

[!freedom]
[!morefreedom]
[!moreforliving]

[moreforliving] implies that in order for to have more freedom, we will
have to be living.  I.e. the more we live, the more things we can do (i.e.
more freedom).

We already know from [maxexplore] that survival maximisation necessarily
implies exploring good science.

Therefore, we now know that these three _have_ to be maximised together
(i.e. one cannot be maximised while not maximising the other), as they're
all essentially synonyms of some kind:

* Survival maximisation.
* Exploration maximisation.
* Freedom maximisation.

##slavery slavery

definition:slavery
text:Slavery is that which reduces freedom.

theorem:drunkinessisslavery
text:Promoting drunkiness is promoting slavery.

[!slavery]

By [drunkbad], [freedom] and [slavery], [drunkinessisslavery] is deduced.

So, next time someonne tells you that he/she/xe is just being _free_ for
getting drunk, you tell them: "Nope!  [drunkinessisslavery] has actually
proven that you're rather choosing slavery!''.
